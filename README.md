# Basic EC2 Startup Scripts 

Startup scripts to prepare a quick instance for any homework for class ST-ISC-517 (Advance Web Programming).

For installation, just pick the .sh depending on the image you installed in your EC2 instance.

```shell
sudo my_image_install.sh 
```


For example, let's say we chose Amazon Linux 2 as our base image.
We would have to chose amazon_linux_2_install.sh.

```shell
sudo amazon_linux_install.sh
```
